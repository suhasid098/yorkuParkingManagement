# Parking Lot App - EECS 3311

The codebase simulates a parking lot app that allows users to book a parking lot in advance with multiple modes of payment. There are 4 types of users, Students, Faculty, Non-Faculty, and Visitors, all of which have their individualized rates and can edit and cancel their booking. Furthermore, this app offers a separate interface for Managers and SuperManagers which regulate the account creation (account verification and creation) and parking lots (disable or enable).
